/**
Imagine a robot sitting on the upper left hand corner of an NxN grid. The
robot can only move in two directions: right and down. How many possible
paths are there for the robot?
FOLLOW UP
Imagine certain squares are "off limits", such that the robot can not
step on them. Design an algorithm to get all possible paths for the robot.

Part 1: (For clarity, we will solve this part assuming an X by Y grid)
