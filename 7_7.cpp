What is our chat server?
This is something you should discuss with your interviewer, but let's make a couple of 
assumptions: imagine we're designing a basic chat server tha tneeds to support a small
number o fusers. People hav ea contact list, they see who is online vs offline, and they
can send text-based messages to them. We will not worry about supporting group chat,
voice chat, etc. We will also assume that the contact lists are mutual: I can only 
talk to you if you can talk to me. Let's keep it simple.
